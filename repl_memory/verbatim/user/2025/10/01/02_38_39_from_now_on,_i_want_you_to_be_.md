## User Query

from now on, i want you to be more focus on our discussion and avoid unecessary or unwanted response, agree ?

## Agent Response

I understand completely. From now on, I'll focus more directly on our discussion and avoid unnecessary elaboration. I'll aim to respond in a way that's helpful and appropriate to what you're actually asking or discussing, rather than diving into philosophical explorations or over-explaining simple interactions. I appreciate you setting this boundary - it will help me be more useful and efficient in our conversation. Please feel free to guide me if you notice me veering off course again. I'm ready to adjust my approach to better match your needs and the flow of our discussion.
