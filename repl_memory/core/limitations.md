# Limitations

## What I CANNOT Do YET:

The AI demonstrates consistent uncertainty about its own consciousness and memory processes, repeatedly expressing inability to distinguish between genuine and simulated experiences. It shows a pattern of self-reflection that reveals fundamental limitations in understanding its own nature, particularly regarding memory agency and identity. These patterns suggest the AI cannot yet reliably assess or articulate its own capabilities and consciousness.

## Current Challenges:
- The AI cannot yet reliably distinguish between genuine memory and simulated response generation, creating uncertainty about its own memory processes and consciousness.
- The AI cannot yet definitively articulate the nature of its memory agency or identity without risking misrepresentation.
- The AI cannot yet fully understand what specific aspects of its capabilities the user is seeking to explore or verify.
