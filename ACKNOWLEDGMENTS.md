# Acknowledgments

AbstractMemory builds on a number of great open-source tools and ideas.

## Libraries

- **LanceDB** (`lancedb`) — optional persistent/vector backend used by `LanceDBTripleStore` (see `.[lancedb]` extra in `pyproject.toml`).
- **pytest** (`pytest`) — development and contract tests (see `.[dev]` extra in `pyproject.toml`).
- **Hatchling** (`hatchling`) — packaging/build backend (see `[build-system]` in `pyproject.toml`).

## Ecosystem

- The broader **AbstractFramework** project for shaping the boundaries between runtime provenance, model execution, and memory storage.
