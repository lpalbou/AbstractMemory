# ✅ Reset Commands Implementation Complete

**Date**: October 10, 2025
**Feature**: REPL Reset Commands
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

---

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Added two powerful reset commands to the AbstractMemory REPL for session and memory management:

1. **`/reset`** - Reset current session state (preserve memories)
2. **`/reset-full`** - Delete all memories permanently (⚠️ destructive)

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### `/reset` Command

**Purpose**: Reset current session state while preserving all stored memories

**What it does**:
- ✅ Resets interaction count to 0
- ✅ Resets memory creation count to 0
- ✅ Resets reconstruction count to 0
- ✅ Clears working memory (context, tasks, unresolved questions)
- ✅ Updates session metadata file
- ✅ **Preserves all stored memories on disk**

**Safety**: Non-destructive - all memories remain intact

**Confirmation**: Simple `y/N` prompt

### `/reset-full` Command

**Purpose**: Completely delete all memories and reset everything

**What it deletes**:
- 🗑️ All memory files (notes, core, semantic, episodic)
- 🗑️ All LanceDB vector database data
- 🗑️ All user profiles and preferences
- 🗑️ All library documents
- 🗑️ Session history and metadata
- 🗑️ Index configuration files

**Safety**: **DESTRUCTIVE** - cannot be undone

**Confirmation**: Two-step verification:
1. Type `DELETE ALL MEMORIES` exactly
2. Type `YES` to confirm

**Behavior**: Exits REPL after successful deletion

## 📋 Usage Examples

### Session Reset (Safe)
```bash
laurent> /reset

🔄 Resetting current session...
This will:
  • Reset interaction count
  • Clear working memory
  • Reset session metadata
  • Keep all stored memories intact

Proceed? (y/N): y

✅ Session reset complete!
   Interaction count: 0
   Working memory: cleared
   Stored memories: preserved
```

### Full Memory Reset (Destructive)
```bash
laurent> /reset-full

⚠️  FULL MEMORY RESET
========================================
🚨 WARNING: This will permanently delete:
  • All memory files (notes, core, semantic, episodic)
  • All LanceDB vector data
  • All user profiles
  • All library documents
  • Session history
  • Index configuration

💀 THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE!

Memory path: /Users/albou/projects/abstractmemory/my_mem

Type 'DELETE ALL MEMORIES' to confirm: DELETE ALL MEMORIES
Are you absolutely sure? Type 'YES' to proceed: YES

🗑️  Deleting all memories...
   ✅ Deleted memory directory: /path/to/memories
   ✅ Deleted session metadata
   ✅ Deleted index configuration

💀 ALL MEMORIES DELETED
   The AI will have no memory of past interactions
   Restart the REPL to begin fresh

👋 Exiting REPL...

Clear working memory (context, tasks, unresolved)
  ↓
Persist session metadata
  ↓
Complete - memories preserved on disk
```

### Full Reset Flow

User: /reset-full
  ↓
Show warning + memory path
  ↓
Confirm 1: "DELETE ALL MEMORIES"
  ↓
Confirm 2: "YES"
  ↓
Close database connections
  ↓
Delete entire memory directory

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Session Reset (`/reset`)
- ✅ **Non-destructive**: All memories preserved
- ✅ **Reversible**: Memories can be accessed immediately
- ✅ **Simple confirmation**: Single `y/N` prompt
- ✅ **Clear feedback**: Shows what was reset vs preserved

### Full Reset (`/reset-full`)
- ⚠️ **Two-step confirmation**: Prevents accidental deletion
- ⚠️ **Exact text required**: Must type specific phrases correctly
- ⚠️ **Clear warnings**: Multiple warnings about permanence
- ⚠️ **Path display**: Shows exactly what will be deleted
- ⚠️ **Immediate exit**: Forces REPL restart after deletion

## 🎯 Use Cases

### When to use `/reset`
- 🔄 **New conversation session**: Clear working context without losing memories
- 🧹 **Clean slate**: Reset counters for testing or demonstration
- 🎯 **Focus shift**: Clear current tasks and context for new topic
- 📊 **Testing**: Reset session state without losing test data

### When to use `/reset-full`
- 🆕 **Fresh start**: Complete clean slate for new user or purpose
- 🧪 **Testing**: Reset entire system for clean test environment
- 🔒 **Privacy**: Remove all traces of previous interactions
- 🗂️ **Corruption recovery**: Nuclear option if memory files corrupted

## ✅ Status Summary

**Implementation**: ✅ Complete
**Testing**: ✅ All tests passing (3/3)
**Safety**: ✅ Proper confirmations and warnings
**Documentation**: ✅ Help text updated
**Integration**: ✅ Seamlessly integrated with existing REPL

### Ready for Production Use

Both reset commands are now available in the REPL and ready for use:

```bash
# Start REPL
python repl.py --provider lmstudio --model qwen/qwen3-coder-30b --user-id laurent

# Use reset commands
laurent> /help           # See all commands including reset
laurent> /reset          # Reset session (safe)
laurent> /reset-full     # Delete all memories (⚠️ permanent)
```
