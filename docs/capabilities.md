## Current Limitations

### Technical Limitations

#### Memory Scale
- **Growth Management** - Large memory stores may impact performance
- **Search Complexity** - Very large memory sets may slow semantic search
- **Storage Requirements** - Dual storage increases disk usage
- **Indexing Time** - Initial indexing of large memory sets takes time

#### Processing Constraints
- **LLM Dependency** - All cognitive assessments require LLM calls
- **Context Limits** - LLM context windows limit how much memory can be included
- **Background Processing** - Some operations happen asynchronously
- **Error Handling** - Memory operations can fail and require fallbacks

### Functional Limitations

#### Memory Accuracy
- **LLM Hallucination** - Memory content depends on LLM accuracy
- **Subjective Assessment** - Emotional and importance scoring is subjective
- **Pattern Recognition** - May identify false patterns in limited data
- **Consolidation Errors** - Automatic consolidation may miss nuances

#### User Privacy
- **Memory Persistence** - All interactions are stored by default
- **Profile Building** - User profiles built without explicit consent
- **Data Retention** - No automatic deletion of old memories
- **Access Control** - Limited fine-grained access controls

### Design Limitations

#### Consciousness Claims
- **No True Consciousness** - System simulates memory-like behavior, not actual consciousness
- **Emergent Behavior** - Identity components emerge from patterns, not genuine self-awareness
- **Anthropomorphic Risk** - May encourage over-attribution of human-like qualities

#### Generalization
- **Domain Specificity** - Works best with conversational interactions
- **Language Dependency** - Optimized for English language interactions
- **Cultural Assumptions** - May embed cultural biases from training data

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Operations
- **Search Speed** - Semantic search typically <1 second for moderate memory sizes
- **Context Reconstruction** - 9-step process typically completes in 2-5 seconds
- **Background Tasks** - Fact extraction and indexing happen asynchronously
- **Consolidation Time** - Core memory consolidation takes 30-60 seconds

### Storage Requirements
- **Dual Storage Overhead** - ~2x storage due to markdown + vector storage
- **Embedding Size** - 384-dimensional vectors for all-minilm-l6-v2 model
- **Index Size** - LanceDB indices scale with memory content
- **File Organization** - Hierarchical structure prevents filesystem limitations

### Scalability
- **Memory Growth** - Linear growth with interaction count
- **Search Performance** - Logarithmic degradation with memory size

## Best Practices

### Effective Usage
- **Start Small** - Begin with focused interactions to build quality memories
