# Command History Feature

## Overview
Added comprehensive command history functionality to the AbstractMemory CLI with arrow key navigation and persistent storage, similar to bash/zsh command history.

## Features Implemented

### âœ… 1. Arrow Key Navigation
- **â†‘ (Up Arrow)**: Navigate to previous commands
- **â†“ (Down Arrow)**: Navigate to next commands
- **Seamless Experience**: Just like bash/zsh terminal behavior

### âœ… 2. Persistent History
- **Storage Location**: `{memory_folder}/.cli_history`
- **Cross-Session**: History survives CLI restarts
- **Memory-Specific**: Each memory folder has its own isolated history
- **Auto-Save**: History saved automatically on exit

### âœ… 3. Smart History Management
- **Deduplication**: Consecutive identical commands are not duplicated
- **Size Limit**: Maximum 1000 commands (auto-pruned)
- **Clean Storage**: Only meaningful commands are stored

### âœ… 4. History Viewing Command
- **`/commands`**: Show last 20 commands
- **`/commands N`**: Show last N commands (max 100)
- **Numbered Display**: Commands shown with relative indices

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Readline Integration
```python
import readline
import os

def _setup_command_history(self):
    """Set up readline for command history and arrow key navigation."""
    # Configure readline with history file
    history_file = self.memory_path / ".cli_history"
    readline.read_history_file(str(history_file))
    readline.set_history_length(1000)
```

#### 2. History Management
```python
def _add_to_history(self, command: str):
    """Add command to history with deduplication."""
    # Skip duplicates and empty commands
    if command.strip() and not_duplicate:
        readline.add_history(command.strip())

def _save_command_history(self):
    """Save history to persistent file."""
    readline.write_history_file(str(self._history_file))
```

#### 3. History Display
```python
def _show_command_history(self, args):
    """Show recent commands in numbered list."""
    # Display last N commands with indices
    # Include usage tips for arrow navigation
```

### Integration Points

1. **Initialization**: History setup in `__init__` method
2. **Input Loop**: History addition after each command
3. **Cleanup**: History saving in `_cleanup` method
4. **Command Handler**: `/commands` command for viewing

## Usage Examples

### Basic Navigation
```bash
# Type some commands
ðŸ‘¤ albou> /facts
ðŸ‘¤ albou> /queue
ðŸ‘¤ albou> what is machine learning?

# Use â†‘ arrow to navigate back through history
ðŸ‘¤ albou> [â†‘] what is machine learning?
ðŸ‘¤ albou> [â†‘] /queue
ðŸ‘¤ albou> [â†‘] /facts
```

### View History
```bash
# Show recent commands
ðŸ‘¤ albou> /commands

ðŸ“œ Command History (last 20 commands)
============================================================
   1. /help
   2. /facts
   3. /queue
   4. what is machine learning?
   5. /memory
   ...

ðŸ’¡ Use â†‘/â†“ arrow keys to navigate through history
============================================================

# Show specific number of commands
ðŸ‘¤ albou> /commands 50
```

### Persistent Across Sessions
```bash
# Session 1
ðŸ‘¤ albou> /facts
ðŸ‘¤ albou> /quit

# Session 2 (after restart)
ðŸ‘¤ albou> [â†‘]  # Shows "/facts" from previous session
```

## File Structure

```
memory/
â”œâ”€â”€ .cli_history          # Command history file
â”œâ”€â”€ working/
â”œâ”€â”€ semantics/
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Cross-Platform Support

### Supported Platforms
- **Linux**: Full readline support
- **macOS**: Full readline support  
- **Windows**: Fallback gracefully if readline unavailable

### Fallback Behavior
```python
try:
    import readline
    # Full history functionality
except ImportError:
    # Graceful degradation - no history but CLI still works
    self._history_file = None
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved UX**: Familiar terminal behavior
2. **Productivity**: Quick access to previous commands
3. **Persistence**: Commands remembered across sessions
4. **Isolation**: Each memory has its own command history
5. **Reliability**: Graceful fallback on unsupported systems

## Error Handling

- **Import Errors**: Graceful fallback if readline unavailable
- **File Errors**: Continue without history if file operations fail
- **Memory Errors**: History size limits prevent memory issues
- **Debug Logging**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- **Search History**: Ctrl+R style reverse search
- **History Filtering**: Filter by command type (/commands vs queries)
- **Export/Import**: Share command history between memories
- **Timestamps**: Show when commands were executed

## Testing

The feature has been tested for:
- âœ… Arrow key navigation
- âœ… History persistence across restarts
- âœ… Deduplication of consecutive commands
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility
- âœ… Error handling and fallbacks
- âœ… Memory isolation (different histories per memory folder)

The command history feature provides a professional, terminal-like experience that users expect from modern CLI tools!
