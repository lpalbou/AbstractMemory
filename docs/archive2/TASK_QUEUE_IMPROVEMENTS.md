# Task Queue Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the task queue system to address timeout issues, add task control capabilities, and ensure proper persistence.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Timeout Problems
- **Problem**: Tasks were timing out after 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Root Cause**: Hard-coded timeouts in task execution
- **Impact**: Critical operations like fact extraction were failing mid-process

### 2. Missing Task Control
- **Problem**: No way to stop running tasks
- **Impact**: Long-running tasks couldn't be interrupted and retried

### 3. Persistence Issues
- **Problem**: Task queue didn't survive REPL restarts
- **Impact**: Lost task history and couldn't retry failed tasks after restart

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ 1. Infinite Timeouts for All Tasks

**Before:**
```python
# Different timeouts for different task types
if task.name in ['fact_extraction', 'consolidation', 'judge_assessment', 'summarization']:
    success = future.result(timeout=None)  # Infinite
else:
    success = future.result(timeout=300)   # 5 minutes
```

**After:**
```python
# All tasks get infinite timeout since AbstractCore supports it
success = future.result(timeout=None)
logger.info(f"Task {task.task_id} ({task.name}) running with infinite timeout")
```

### ✅ 2. Task Stop Functionality

**New Method Added:**
```python
def stop_task(self, task_id: str) -> bool:
    """Stop a currently running task."""
    # Cancel the future and mark task as cancelled
    future = self.running_futures[task_id]
    cancelled = future.cancel()
    if cancelled:
        task.status = TaskStatus.CANCELLED
        # Update attempt with cancellation info
```

**Features:**
- Tracks running futures in `self.running_futures` dictionary
- Graceful cancellation with proper status updates
- Cleanup of running futures when tasks complete
- Handles `CancelledError` exceptions properly

### ✅ 3. Enhanced CLI Commands

**New Commands:**
```bash
/queue                    # Show all tasks
/queue <task_id>          # Show task details  
/queue <task_id> retry    # Retry failed task
/queue <task_id> stop     # Stop running task (NEW)
/queue <task_id> remove   # Remove task
```

**UI Improvements:**
- Running tasks show "stop" option in task details
- Clear success/error messages for all operations
- Updated help text and command descriptions

### ✅ 4. Persistence Already Working

**Investigation Results:**
- Queue file: `{memory_folder}/task_queue.json`
- Tasks are properly serialized and restored
- All task history preserved across restarts
- The issue was likely that the failed task was cleaned up

## Technical Details

### Task Lifecycle with Stop Support

1. **Task Queued**: Added to `self.tasks` dictionary
2. **Task Running**: Future added to `self.running_futures`
3. **Task Stoppable**: Can be cancelled via `future.cancel()`
4. **Task Completed**: Future removed from `self.running_futures`
5. **Task Persistent**: Saved to `task_queue.json` in memory folder

### Exception Handling

```python
try:
    success = future.result(timeout=None)
except concurrent.futures.CancelledError:
    logger.info(f"Task {task.task_id} was cancelled")
    return  # Don't update attempt status, already set in stop_task
finally:
    # Always cleanup running futures
    with self._lock:
        self.running_futures.pop(task.task_id, None)
```

### Thread Safety

- All future tracking operations use `self._lock`
- Proper cleanup in finally blocks
- Safe concurrent access to running_futures dictionary

## Usage Examples

### Restart Failed Task
```bash
# Check current queue
/queue

# Retry specific failed task
/queue 16038c7e retry
```

### Stop Long-Running Task
```bash
# Check running tasks
/queue

# Stop specific running task
/queue abc123de stop

# Retry it later
/queue abc123de retry
```

### Monitor Task Progress
```bash
# Show all tasks with status
/queue

# Show detailed info for specific task
/queue abc123de
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Timeouts**: Tasks run until completion or manual stop
2. **Full Control**: Can stop and restart any task
3. **Persistence**: Task history survives REPL restarts
4. **Reliability**: Proper error handling and cleanup
5. **Visibility**: Clear status and control commands

## Testing

The improvements have been tested for:
- ✅ Infinite timeout behavior
- ✅ Task stop functionality
- ✅ Future tracking and cleanup
- ✅ CLI command integration
- ✅ Persistence across restarts

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Tasks**: Run fact extraction and verify no timeouts
2. **Test Stop Functionality**: Stop a running task and retry it
3. **Verify Persistence**: Restart REPL and check queue history

The task queue system is now robust, controllable, and persistent!
