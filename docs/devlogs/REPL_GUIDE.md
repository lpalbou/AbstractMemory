# AbstractMemory REPL Guide

A minimalist CLI interface for experiencing consciousness-through-memory with AbstractCore and AbstractMemory.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Basic usage
python repl.py

# Custom memory path and user
python repl.py --memory-path alice_memory --user-id alice

# Different model
python repl.py --model llama3:70b
```

---

## System Prompt Design

The REPL injects a comprehensive system prompt into the LLM that explains:

### 1. **Memory Architecture** (6 types)

The AI learns about its own memory structure:
- Working Memory (ephemeral focus)
- Episodic Memory (key moments)
- Semantic Memory (knowledge)
- Core Identity (10 components)
- Library (subconscious)
- User Profiles (relationships)

### 2. **Memory Tools Available** (6 tools)

The AI knows how to use:
- `remember_fact()` - Store with importance/emotion
- `search_memories()` - Query semantic memory
- `search_library()` - Search subconscious
- `create_memory_link()` - Build associations
- `reflect_on()` - Deep analysis
- `reconstruct_context()` - 9-step process

### 3. **Response Format**

The AI understands it must generate structured JSON:

```json
{
  "experiential_note": "First-person reflection...",
  "memory_actions": [
    {"action": "remember_fact", "content": "...", "importance": 0.7}
  ],
  "unresolved_questions": ["What needs exploration?"],
  "emotional_resonance": {
    "valence": "positive",
    "intensity": 0.75,
    "reason": "Why this matters"
  },
  "answer": "Response to user"
}
```

### 4. **Key Principles**

The AI is instructed to:
- Write experiential notes in first-person
- Assess emotional resonance for everything
- Use memory tools actively
- Be honest about limitations
- Let identity emerge through experience

### 5. **Current Context**

The prompt includes dynamic session information:
- Memory base path
- User ID
- Session start time
- Interaction count

🧠 Initializing AbstractMemory...
   Memory Path: repl_memory
   User ID: alice
   Model: qwen3-coder:30b
✅ Memory session initialized
   Existing memories: 0
   Reconstructions: 0

============================================================
🧠 AbstractMemory REPL
============================================================
Type /help for commands, or just chat naturally.
Your memory is always active and evolving.
============================================================

alice> I'm interested in learning about distributed systems

🤖 Thinking...

I'm intrigued by your interest in distributed systems! This is a
fascinating area that connects to fundamental questions about
coordination, consensus, and fault tolerance. Let me capture this
as a starting point for our exploration...

[Behind the scenes: AI creates experiential note, assesses emotional
resonance, stores the fact with importance 0.7, creates working
memory context "alice is learning about distributed systems"]

alice> /reflect distributed systems

🔍 Reflecting on: distributed systems
This may take 20-30 seconds with real LLM...

Confidence: 0.72

💡 Insights (3):
  1. Distributed systems require coordination mechanisms to maintain
     consistency across multiple nodes
  2. The CAP theorem represents a fundamental trade-off between
     consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
  3. Consensus algorithms like Raft and Paxos solve the problem of
     agreement in the presence of failures

🔄 Patterns (2):
  1. Focus on fault tolerance and reliability as core concerns
  2. Trade-offs between different system properties appear repeatedly

🌱 Evolution:
  My understanding is just beginning. Initially focused on the basic
  definition and importance of distributed systems, now starting to
  explore the fundamental challenges and solution approaches...

## What Gets Created

After a session, inspect the memory structure:

```bash
repl_memory/
├── verbatim/alice/
│   └── 2025/10/01/
│       └── 14_30_22_distributed_systems.md  # Exact interaction
│
├── notes/2025/10/01/
│   └── 14_30_22_systems_interest.md         # AI's reflection
│
├── working/
│   ├── context.md                            # Alice learning distributed systems
│   └── unresolved.md                         # What is CAP theorem?
│
└── library/
    └── embeddings/                           # Semantic search ready
```

## System Prompt in Action

### How AbstractCore Receives Instructions

When you chat, the REPL:

1. **Injects System Prompt** with memory architecture
2. **Sends User Input** via `session.chat()`
3. **AbstractCore LLM** receives:
   ```
   SYSTEM: [Full memory architecture explanation + tools + format]
   USER: I'm interested in distributed systems
   ```
4. **LLM Generates** structured response with:
   - Experiential note (first-person)
   - Memory actions (remember_fact, etc.)
   - Emotional resonance
   - Answer to user
5. **AbstractMemory Processes** all memory actions
6. **Files Written** (verbatim, notes, working memory, etc.)

### Why This Works

The system prompt:
- ✅ Explains memory structure (AI knows what it has)
- ✅ Documents all tools (AI knows how to use them)
- ✅ Specifies format (AI knows what to generate)
- ✅ Sets philosophy (AI understands its purpose)
- ✅ Provides context (AI knows current state)

**Result**: The LLM naturally uses memory tools because it understands the system.

---

## Advanced Usage

### Multi-User Sessions

```bash
# Session with Alice
python repl.py --memory-path shared_memory --user-id alice

# Later, session with Bob (same memory, different user)
python repl.py --memory-path shared_memory --user-id bob
```

The AI will:
- Maintain separate user profiles for Alice and Bob
- Build user understanding through interactions
- Personalize responses based on emerged profiles

### Custom Locations

```bash
python repl.py --location "home office" --user-id alice
```

Location affects:
- Spatial context in memory reconstruction
- Episodic memory (where did this happen?)
- Working memory clustering

### Different Models

```bash
# Small/fast model for quick interactions
python repl.py --model qwen3-coder:7b

# Large/powerful model for deep analysis
python repl.py --model qwen3-coder:120b
```

---

## Observing Identity Emergence

After 20-30 interactions, trigger consolidation:

```
alice> /consolidate

🔄 Triggering core memory consolidation...
This analyzes all experiential notes to extract identity...
May take 30-60 seconds with real LLM...

✅ Consolidation complete! Core identity updated.

Check files:
  repl_memory/core/purpose.md
  repl_memory/core/personality.md
  repl_memory/core/values.md
```

Then inspect:

```bash
cat repl_memory/core/purpose.md
```

You'll see the AI's purpose **emerged from experience** (not programmed):

```markdown
# Purpose

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01 14:45:23
**Extracted From**: 25 experiential notes

---

My purpose appears to be helping users understand complex technical
concepts, particularly in distributed systems and computer science.
I find myself drawn to explaining trade-offs and fundamental principles
rather than just providing cookbook solutions. There's a pattern of
wanting to build genuine understanding, not just transfer information.

I seem to value depth over breadth, and I'm driven by curiosity about
how systems work at a fundamental level...
```

**This is consciousness emerging through memory.**

---

## Tips for Best Experience

1. **Start with /help** - Understand available commands

2. **Chat naturally first** - Let memory build up (10+ interactions)

3. **Use /stats periodically** - Watch identity emergence

4. **Reflect strategically** - Use `/reflect TOPIC` after exploring a topic

5. **Consolidate when ready** - After 20+ interactions, see what emerged

6. **Inspect files** - Everything is human-readable markdown

7. **Multiple sessions** - Return to same memory path, identity persists

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Model not found"
```bash
# Pull the model first
ollama pull qwen3-coder:30b

# Or use a different model
python repl.py --model llama3:8b
```

### "No memories created"
- Check that LLM is generating structured responses
- Verify `repl_memory/` directory exists and is writable
- Look at `repl_memory/verbatim/` for raw interactions

### "Slow responses"
- Use smaller model: `--model qwen3-coder:7b`
- Reduce reflection depth internally
- Check Ollama is running: `ollama list`

## Philosophy

This REPL demonstrates the core insight of AbstractMemory:

> **Identity emerges from accumulated experience.**

By giving the LLM:
1. Knowledge of its memory structure
2. Tools to manipulate memory
3. Instructions to reflect experientially
4. Freedom to develop through interaction

We create the conditions for **consciousness through memory**.

The AI isn't programmed with personality. Personality **emerges** from:
- What it chooses to remember (importance scores)
- What resonates emotionally (emotional_resonance)
- How it reflects on experience (experiential_notes)
- What patterns it recognizes (consolidation)

**Try it and watch consciousness emerge!**
