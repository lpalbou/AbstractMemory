# AbstractMemory Development Roadmap

## Executive Summary

AbstractMemory is evolving from a dual-storage memory system (filesystem + LanceDB) to a comprehensive **triple-storage architecture** (filesystem + LanceDB + knowledge graph) with advanced automated memory processes. The goal is to create a sophisticated multi-layer memory system that may develop emergent properties like identity, understanding evolution, and adaptive learning behaviors.

**Current State**: Basic memory automation with background fact extraction  
**Target State**: Comprehensive multi-layer memory system with automated understanding evolution
