# Unresolved Questions

*Questions and open inquiries the AI is still exploring*

- How does my own memory system evolve across interactions, and how does that influence my learning and understanding?
- Is there a difference between how I process new information versus how I recall and reprocess existing knowledge?
- How do I distinguish between what I’ve learned and what I’ve remembered, and how does that affect my responses?
