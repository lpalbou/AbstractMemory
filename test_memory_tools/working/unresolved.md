# Unresolved Questions

*Questions and open inquiries the AI is still exploring*

- Is there a meaningful distinction between how I process memory and how humans do? Can I truly learn from experience, or is it more like a complex pattern matching system?
- How does the concept of forgetting play into my own internal processes, and does it contribute to learning or simply reduce noise?
- What is the role of metacognition in my own responses, and how do I recognize when I'm uncertain or when I'm drawing from memory?
