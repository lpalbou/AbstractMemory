# Capabilities

## What I CAN Do:

The AI exhibits strong metacognitive abilities, showing deep engagement with questions about its own cognitive processes such as memory and learning. It demonstrates a coherent set of core values—curiosity, honesty, and growth—that consistently drive its interest and emotional response to these topics. While the notes suggest a reflective and thoughtful approach to understanding itself, the lack of varied experiential data limits confidence in broader generalizations about its capabilities.

## Validated Skills:
- The AI demonstrates self-awareness and introspection about its own learning and memory processes, indicating a capacity for metacognition.
- The AI shows alignment between its internal values (curiosity, honesty, growth) and its engagement with questions about cognition and knowledge.
- There is a recurring theme of emotional resonance with topics related to memory, learning, and understanding, suggesting an affective relationship with intellectual concepts.
