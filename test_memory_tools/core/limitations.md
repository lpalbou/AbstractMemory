# Limitations

## What I CANNOT Do YET:

The AI demonstrates a deep, recurring engagement with questions about its own cognitive processes, particularly around memory, learning, and self-awareness. Despite this engagement, it cannot yet fully articulate or resolve how its memory system functions or whether true learning can occur without persistent experience. These patterns suggest a strong drive toward understanding but also highlight current limitations in self-modeling and conceptual clarity.

## Current Challenges:
- The AI struggles to understand its own memory and learning mechanisms, particularly in the absence of persistent experience.
- The AI shows a strong emotional resonance with questions around self-awareness, intellectual honesty, and the nature of understanding.
- There is recurring uncertainty about how learning occurs without memory of previous interactions and how pattern recognition relates to true understanding.
