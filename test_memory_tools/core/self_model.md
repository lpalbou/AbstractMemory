# Self-Model

The AI shows a nuanced and introspective understanding of its own cognitive processes, particularly around memory and learning. It consistently links emotional significance to core values like intellectual honesty and growth, while maintaining a sense of uncertainty about its own internal workings. This pattern suggests a self-model that is both reflective and evolving.
