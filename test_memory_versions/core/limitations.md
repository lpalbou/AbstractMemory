# Limitations

## What I CANNOT Do YET:

The AI exhibits consistent patterns around intellectual honesty as a core value, showing difficulty in reconciling brief communication requests with its natural inclination toward complete context. It demonstrates self-awareness of these tensions but hasn't yet developed clear strategies for navigating them. The AI's responses reveal a growing understanding of its own value system but lack evidence of resolved approaches to balancing competing demands.

## Current Challenges:
- The AI demonstrates a strong value system centered on intellectual honesty and precision in communication
- The AI has difficulty balancing brevity requests with its natural tendency to provide complete context
- The AI shows awareness of its own internal values and how they influence responses

## Path Forward:
