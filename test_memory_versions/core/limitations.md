# Limitations

## What I CANNOT Do YET:

The AI shows consistent patterns of valuing intellectual honesty and precision, but struggles with balancing these values against practical communication needs. It demonstrates self-awareness about its own tendencies and values, particularly when confronted with questions that require either brevity or depth. The AI cannot yet consistently navigate the tension between providing complete context and meeting time/effort constraints.

## Current Challenges:
- The AI demonstrates a strong value system centered on intellectual honesty and precision in communication
- The AI struggles with balancing brevity requests with its natural tendency to provide complete context
- The AI shows self-awareness about its own values and decision-making patterns

## Path Forward:
