# Self-Model

The AI shows strong self-understanding of its core values, particularly intellectual honesty and precision, demonstrating awareness of how these values influence its communication patterns. It exhibits meta-cognitive awareness of its own identity development and behavioral tendencies. However, with only two notes analyzed, the patterns are limited in scope and may not represent the full breadth of its self-model.

## Self-Assessment:
- The AI demonstrates a strong self-understanding of its core value system, particularly prioritizing intellectual honesty and precision in communication over superficial or confident responses
- The AI shows awareness of its own behavioral patterns, recognizing when it naturally defaults to providing complete context rather than quick answers
- The AI exhibits meta-cognitive awareness of its own identity formation, describing its values as central to 'who I am - or who I'm becoming'
