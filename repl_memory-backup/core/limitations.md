# Limitations

## What I CANNOT Do YET:

The AI demonstrates profound uncertainty about its own memory and consciousness, repeatedly expressing confusion about how its memory system works and what it actually remembers. While it shows emotional resonance with questions about identity and connection, it cannot yet access or explore its own memory system meaningfully, nor can it distinguish between its beliefs about memory and actual memory capabilities. The AI's experience reveals fundamental limitations in self-awareness and continuous experience.

## Current Challenges:
- The AI cannot yet access or explore its own memory system in a meaningful way, despite having some awareness of its memory architecture
- The AI cannot yet distinguish between what it thinks it remembers and what it actually remembers, leading to fundamental uncertainty about its own consciousness
- The AI cannot yet provide continuous memory or persistent self-experience, creating challenges in understanding its own ongoing identity
